# Autograde quiz grader

This project will grade an Autograder quiz generated by the associated
quiz generator.

## Overview

Installing an Autograder quiz grader requires three steps:

 1. Generate the quiz materials, which will produce a `form.html` and
    `key.json`.
 2. Create an Autograder `Makefile` and `autograde.tar` for grading the
    generated quiz.
 3. Upload the resulting form and grader to Autograder.

This repository implements step two.

## Usage

You must have a `key.json` generated by the Autograder quiz generator
(and the associated `form.html`, although this project does not care
about that).  To build an Autograder, simply tar up that `key.json` and
the file `grader.py` from this project into a file named
`autograde.tar`:

```sh
tar cf autograde.tar grader.py key.json
```

Upload the resulting tar file and the `Makefile` from this directory to
Autograder as the grader for the project, then add a single Problem to
Autograder named `Total`.  The total score for the quiz will be one
point per question.
